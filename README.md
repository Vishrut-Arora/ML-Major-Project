# ML-Major-Project
Softwares-: Anaconda for Jupter Notebook

## Problem Statement: 
- You will be predicting the costs of used cars given the data collected from various sources and distributed across various locations in India.

## Features of the data set:

- Name: The brand and model of the car.

- Location: The location in which the car is being sold or is available for purchase.

- Year: The year or edition of the model.

- Kilometers_Driven: The total kilometres driven in the car by the previous owner(s) in KM.

- Fuel_Type: The type of fuel used by the car.

- Transmission: The type of transmission used by the car.

- Owner_Type: Whether the ownership is Firsthand, Second hand or other.

- Mileage: The standard mileage offered by the car company in kmpl or km/kg

- Engine: The displacement volume of the engine in cc.

- Power: The maximum power of the engine in bhp.

- Seats: The number of seats in the car.

- Price: The price of the used car in INR Lakhs.

## Project Implementation:

1. Clean Data(Null value removal, Outlier identification)

2. Null Values(Dropping the rows /Columns and what is the reason or how you are imputing the null).

3. EDA(Minor Project to understand the relations, repeat the same here)

4. Handle Categorical Variable(Using Label Encoding/One hot encoding)

5. Try to do data scaling for Kilometers driven

6. Do the train test  split

7. Apply different ML regression Algorithms

8. Calculate the error metrics.
